# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## 1.1 Product Overview

**Career Launch Platform** is a video platform designed for Ontario high school educators to easily show career education content to their students while accurately measuring student reach for reporting and sponsor engagement.

### Elevator Pitch
A video platform that makes it easy for teachers to show career videos to their students, and tells presenters exactly how many students watched their session.

### Event Details
- **Name:** Career Launch Week
- **Dates:** December 1-5, 2025
- **Participating Boards:** 20+ Ontario school boards
- **Content:** 25 career sessions across healthcare, technology, trades, business, and more
- **Target Audience:** Grades 9-12 educators and students

---

## 1.2 Problem Statement

### For School Boards & Event Organizers
Traditional event platforms can't distinguish between "1 teacher previewing a video" and "1 teacher showing it to 30 students," making it impossible to measure true student impact or justify the cost of career education programming.

### For Educators
Participating in career events means yet another login, another password to remember, and cumbersome registration flows—creating friction that busy teachers simply don't have time for during a packed school week.

### For Sponsors/Presenters
Industry professionals donating their time to create career education content have no way to demonstrate the real-world impact of their contribution, making it hard to justify continued participation or secure organizational buy-in.

---

## 1.3 Solution: Browse-First Video Platform

### The Key Innovation
**Show value BEFORE asking for commitment.**

Instead of forcing registration before browsing, educators can explore all 25 sessions immediately. We only collect information when they're highly committed (clicked "Watch with Your Class" on a specific session).

### Core Flow
```
Homepage → Browse 25 Sessions Instantly → Click Session → Combined Registration Form → Watch Video
Time to browse: <1 second (vs 60+ seconds with traditional registration)
Time to first video: <30 seconds (vs 90+ seconds with traditional registration)
```

### What Makes This Different

#### 1. Zero-Friction Browsing
- **No registration required to explore content**
- All 25 sessions visible immediately
- Watch trailers without any barriers
- One-time information collection only when ready to watch

#### 2. Honest Impact Measurement
- **Captures actual student reach, not just "views"**
- Combined form collects: class size, grade level, educator profile
- Distinguishes between educator previews and classroom viewing
- Tracks completion rates and engagement patterns

#### 3. Smart 4-Block Structure
- **Mirrors Ontario high school schedule** (4 periods/day)
- Prevents students from seeing duplicate content across classes
- ~6 sessions per block = variety within structure
- Manual curation ensures industry diversity in each block

#### 4. Built for Real Teaching Contexts
- **Pre-fills previous selections** (1-second for repeat users)
- All recorded content = works with any school's schedule
- No live timing constraints or scheduling conflicts
- Cookie-based memory for returning educators

## 1.4 Target Audience

### Primary: Ontario High School Educators
- Teachers, guidance counselors, administrators (Grades 9-12)
- Teaching 4 periods per day across various subjects
- Limited prep time, device-agnostic access needs
- Avoid tools requiring complex setup or login
- Need classroom-ready content with minimal friction

### Secondary: School Board Administrators
- Decision-makers who purchase access for their entire board
- Need participation data to justify investment and renewal
- Want insights on which schools engaged and how
- Require evidence of student reach beyond simple view counts

### Tertiary: Session Sponsors/Presenters
- Industry professionals and organizations providing career content
- Need evidence of impact to justify time and resources invested
- Want concrete metrics for internal reporting
- Seek understanding of audience demographics and engagement

---

## 1.5 Success Metrics at a Glance

**North Star Metric:** Total Student Reach = Sum of all class sizes across all viewing sessions

**Launch Targets (Dec 1-5):**
- 50% of visitors watch ≥1 video
- 3 average sessions per active educator
- 70% session completion rate (watch ≥80%)
- 95% form completion rate
- 40,000+ total student reach

---

# 2. PRODUCT VISION & VALUE PROPOSITION

## 2.1 Unique Selling Propositions

### Browse-First Access
**No registration barrier prevents educators from seeing value**

- Explore all 25 sessions instantly
- Watch trailers without providing any information
- Bookmark sessions before committing
- Only register when ready to show to class

**Why this matters:** Traditional platforms force registration upfront, causing 40-60% drop-off before educators even see the content. We show value first, collect information at peak commitment.

### Honest Impact Measurement
**Transform raw view counts into meaningful student reach data**

- Capture actual class size (not just "1 view")
- Track grade level distribution
- Measure completion rates
- Distinguish educator previews from classroom viewing

**Why this matters:** Sponsors need proof of impact. Boards need ROI justification. "12,500 students reached across 8 schools" is infinitely more valuable than "437 video views."

### Smart Content Organization
**4-block structure prevents content repetition for students**

If a student is in multiple participating classes (e.g., English Period 1 and Civics Period 3), they won't see the same session twice because each block has different options.

**Why this matters:** Respects student time, increases overall reach, provides better experience for multi-class participants.

### Returning User Magic
**Cookie-based pre-fill makes repeat watching effortless**

First watch: Fill 6-field form once (~20 seconds)  
Subsequent watches: Click "Start Video" immediately (~1 second)

**Why this matters:** Educators who have positive first experience will show multiple sessions. Low friction = higher engagement = more student reach.

## 2.2 What Success Looks Like

### For Educators
> "I browsed all the sessions during my prep period, found three perfect for my classes. When I showed the first one, I filled out a quick form. The next two sessions? One click and we were watching. Easiest professional development integration I've ever done."

### For School Boards
> "We reached 2,100 students across 15 schools with 78% educator participation. Teachers loved how easy it was—let's expand to more schools next year and renew for Career Launch 2026."

### For Sponsors
> "My session reached 1,800 students across Ontario with an 85% completion rate. I showed my CEO the data and secured budget for next year's sessions. This is exactly the impact measurement we needed."

---

## 2.3 Competitive Positioning

### vs. YouTube/Open Access
**We provide:** Structured pathways, engagement tracking, professional presentation  
**They lack:** Any measurement, organized discovery, ROI justification

### vs. Traditional Event Platforms
**We provide:** No registration barriers, actual student reach measurement  
**They force:** Complex registration, only track "views" not impact

### vs. Live Webinars
**We provide:** Flexible timing, no scheduling conflicts, always accessible  
**They require:** Fixed schedules, technical coordination, limited replay options

### vs. Static Resource Sites
**We provide:** Engagement tracking, structured discovery, actionable reporting  
**They lack:** Any analytics, organized browsing, measurable outcomes

- Total friction: ~24 seconds across entire event week

**vs Old Registration Flow:**
- Email entry: 10 seconds
- Profile setup: 30 seconds
- Context form: 15 seconds × 5 sessions = 75 seconds
- Total friction: 115 seconds (nearly 5x more)

## 4.2 Data Schema

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  board_id TEXT NOT NULL,           -- e.g., "toronto-dsb"
  school_id TEXT NOT NULL,           -- e.g., "central-high-123"
  custom_school TEXT,                -- If "My school isn't listed"
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('Guidance Counsellor', 'Subject Teacher', 'Administrator', 'Other')),
  subject_area TEXT,                 -- Optional, for future filtering
  last_class_size TEXT,              -- For pre-fill
  last_grade_level TEXT,             -- For pre-fill
  registered_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_login TIMESTAMPTZ,
  CONSTRAINT valid_email CHECK (email ~* '^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$')
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_board ON users(board_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_school ON users(school_id);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- `email` is unique but not verified (trust model)
- `last_class_size` and `last_grade_level` enable pre-fill
- `board_id` and `school_id` for post-event reporting by board/school
- `custom_school` captures educators from unlisted schools

### Sessions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,         -- URL-friendly identifier
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Full description (3-4 paragraphs)
  presenter_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  presenter_bio TEXT,
  presenter_photo_url TEXT,
  duration INTEGER NOT NULL,         -- Duration in minutes
  block_number INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (block_number BETWEEN 1 AND 4),
  industry TEXT NOT NULL,            -- Healthcare, Tech, Trades, etc.
  grade_level TEXT NOT NULL,         -- "9-10", "11-12", "9-12"
  thumbnail_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  trailer_url TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Vimeo embed URL
  full_video_url TEXT NOT NULL,      -- Vimeo embed URL
  learning_objectives JSONB,         -- Array of bullet points
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_block ON sessions(block_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_industry ON sessions(industry);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_slug ON sessions(slug);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- `block_number` enforces 4-block organization
- `slug` for clean URLs (/session/nursing-career-pathways)
- `learning_objectives` as JSONB for flexibility
- Separate `trailer_url` and `full_video_url` (different Vimeo videos)

### ViewingEvents Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE viewing_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  class_size TEXT NOT NULL,          -- "Less than 25", "25 to 35", "Large group"
  custom_student_count INTEGER,      -- Only if class_size = "Large group"
  grade_level TEXT NOT NULL,         -- "9-10", "11-12", "Mixed"
  estimated_students INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Calculated from class_size
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  watch_duration INTEGER DEFAULT 0,  -- Total seconds watched
  completion_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (completion_percentage BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,   -- True if watched >= 80%
  device_type TEXT,                  -- "desktop", "mobile", "tablet"
  browser_type TEXT,                 -- "Chrome", "Firefox", etc.
  user_agent TEXT                    -- Full user agent string
);

CREATE INDEX idx_viewing_events_user ON viewing_events(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_viewing_events_session ON viewing_events(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_viewing_events_started ON viewing_events(started_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_viewing_events_completed ON viewing_events(completed);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Links both `user_id` and `session_id` for rich querying
- `estimated_students` is the key metric for "student reach"
- `completion_percentage` tracks engagement quality
- `watch_duration` in seconds for precision
- Device/browser tracking for post-event analysis

### Boards Table (Reference Data)
```sql
CREATE TABLE boards (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,               -- "toronto-dsb"
  name TEXT NOT NULL,                -- "Toronto District School Board"
  domain_pattern TEXT NOT NULL,      -- "@torontodsb.ca"
  contact_email TEXT,
  participating BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_boards_domain ON boards(domain_pattern);
```

### Schools Table (Reference Data)
```sql
CREATE TABLE schools (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,               -- "central-high-123"
  name TEXT NOT NULL,                -- "Central High School"
  board_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES boards(id),
  address TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_schools_board ON schools(board_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_schools_name ON schools(name);
```

## 4.3 Cookie Structure & Management

### Cookie Schema
```javascript
{
  name: "clp_session",
  value: {
    email: "jane.smith@torontodsb.ca",
    lastSubmission: {
      name: "Jane Smith",
      schoolId: "central-high-123",
      role: "Subject Teacher",
      classSize: "25 to 35",
      customStudentCount: null,
      gradeLevel: "11-12"
    },
    timestamp: "2025-12-01T09:15:00Z"
  },
  expires: 7 days from last update,
  secure: true (production only),
  sameSite: "lax",
  httpOnly: false  // JavaScript needs access for pre-fill
}
```

### Cookie Lifecycle
1. **Creation:** When user first submits combined form
2. **Update:** Every time user submits form (even for same session)
3. **Read:** When combined form modal opens (for pre-fill)
4. **Expiration:** 7 days from last activity (covers event week + buffer)

### Pre-fill Logic
```javascript
function getPreFillData() {
  const cookie = getCookie('clp_session');
  
  if (!cookie) {
    return null;  // New user, show empty form
  }
  
  const age = Date.now() - new Date(cookie.timestamp).getTime();
  const sevenDays = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
  
  if (age > sevenDays) {
    return null;  // Cookie expired, show empty form
  }
  
  return cookie.lastSubmission;  // Return pre-fill data
}

function renderCombinedForm(sessionId) {
  const preFillData = getPreFillData();
  
  return (
    <CombinedForm
      sessionId={sessionId}
      initialValues={preFillData}  // Will be null or object
      onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}
    />
  );
}
```

### Security Considerations
- **No sensitive data in cookie:** Only user-provided info (name, school, preferences)
- **No authentication token:** Cookie is for UX (pre-fill), not security
- **SameSite protection:** Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure flag in production:** HTTPS only
- **Short expiration:** 7 days is reasonable for event context

## 4.4 API Endpoints (via Supabase Client)

### Create/Update User
```javascript
// POST to users table
async function upsertUser(userData) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .upsert({
      email: userData.email,
      name: userData.name,
      board_id: userData.boardId,
      school_id: userData.schoolId,
      role: userData.role,
      last_class_size: userData.classSize,
      last_grade_level: userData.gradeLevel,
      last_login: new Date().toISOString()
    }, {
      onConflict: 'email',  // Update if email exists
      ignoreDuplicates: false
    });
    
  return { data, error };
}
```

### Create ViewingEvent
```javascript
// POST to viewing_events table
async function createViewingEvent(eventData) {
  const estimatedStudents = calculateStudents(
    eventData.classSize,
    eventData.customStudentCount
  );
  
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('viewing_events')
    .insert({
      user_id: eventData.userId,
      session_id: eventData.sessionId,
      class_size: eventData.classSize,
      custom_student_count: eventData.customStudentCount,
      grade_level: eventData.gradeLevel,
      estimated_students: estimatedStudents,
      device_type: getDeviceType(),
      browser_type: getBrowserType(),
      user_agent: navigator.userAgent
    });
    
  return { data, error };
}

function calculateStudents(classSize, customCount) {
  const mapping = {
    "Less than 25": 20,        // Conservative estimate
    "25 to 35": 30,            // Midpoint
    "Large group": customCount // Use exact number
  };
  return mapping[classSize];
}
```

### Update ViewingEvent (Tracking)
```javascript
// PATCH to viewing_events table
async function updateViewingProgress(eventId, progressData) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('viewing_events')
    .update({
      watch_duration: progressData.duration,
      completion_percentage: progressData.percentage,
      completed: progressData.percentage >= 80,
      completed_at: progressData.percentage >= 80 
        ? new Date().toISOString() 
        : null
    })
    .eq('id', eventId);
    
  return { data, error };
}
```

### Fetch Sessions (Public)
```javascript
// GET from sessions table
async function fetchSessionsByBlock(blockNumber) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('sessions')
    .select('*')
    .eq('block_number', blockNumber)
    .order('title', { ascending: true });
    
  return { data, error };
}

async function fetchAllSessions() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('sessions')
    .select('*')
    .order('block_number', { ascending: true });
    
  return { data, error };
}
```

---

## 4.5 Video Player Integration (Vimeo SDK)

### Player Initialization
```javascript
import Player from '@vimeo/player';

function initializePlayer(videoUrl, viewingEventId) {
  const iframe = document.querySelector('iframe');
  const player = new Player(iframe);
  
  // Track play event
  player.on('play', () => {
    trackEvent('video_play', { viewingEventId });
  });
  
  // Track progress every 5 seconds
  player.on('timeupdate', throttle((data) => {
    const percentage = (data.seconds / data.duration) * 100;
    updateViewingProgress(viewingEventId, {
      duration: Math.floor(data.seconds),
      percentage: Math.floor(percentage)
    });
  }, 5000));
  
  // Track completion
  player.on('ended', () => {
    trackEvent('video_complete', { viewingEventId });
    updateViewingProgress(viewingEventId, {
      duration: data.duration,
      percentage: 100
    });
  });
  
  return player;
}
```

### Completion Tracking Logic
```javascript
function shouldMarkComplete(percentage) {
  return percentage >= 80;  // 80% threshold
}

async function checkAndMarkComplete(viewingEventId, currentPercentage) {
  if (shouldMarkComplete(currentPercentage)) {
    await supabase
      .from('viewing_events')
      .update({
        completed: true,
        completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
      })
      .eq('id', viewingEventId)
      .eq('completed', false);  // Only update if not already marked
  }
}
```

# 5. FEATURE SPECIFICATIONS

## 5.1 Feature 1: Public Schedule Landing Page

### User Story
**As a visitor**, I want to browse all career sessions immediately without any registration, so that I can explore content and decide what's relevant for my students before committing any time or information.

### Priority
**P0 - Must Have** (This is the landing page - the entire platform starts here)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- **Given** I visit the homepage URL
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** I see the 4-block schedule with all 25 sessions displayed
- **And** I see no login prompt, no registration form, no barriers
- **And** I can browse, scroll, and click without providing any information

#### Session Card Display
- **Given** I am viewing the schedule page
- **When** I look at a session card
- **Then** I see:
  - Thumbnail image (high quality, optimized for web)
  - Session title
  - Presenter name
  - Duration in minutes
  - Grade level tags (9-10, 11-12, or 9-12)
  - Industry category (Healthcare, Tech, Trades, etc.)
- **And** the card is clickable
- **And** optional: star icon for favorites (if P1 feature built)

#### Block Organization
- **Given** I am viewing the schedule
- **When** I scroll down
- **Then** I see 4 distinct blocks clearly labeled:
  - "Block 1 - Choose any session from this block"
  - "Block 2 - Choose any session from this block"
  - "Block 3 - Choose any session from this block"
  - "Block 4 - Choose any session from this block"
- **And** each block contains 5-7 sessions
- **And** no session appears in multiple blocks
- **And** blocks are visually separated (whitespace, dividers, or distinct backgrounds)

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Given** I am viewing on a mobile device (320px-767px width)
- **When** I scroll through the schedule
- **Then** blocks stack vertically
- **And** session cards are 1-2 per row (depending on device width)
- **And** all text remains readable without horizontal scrolling
- **And** images scale appropriately
- **And** touch targets are ≥44x44px

#### Performance
- **Given** I visit the homepage on a 3G connection
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** First Contentful Paint occurs in <1.5 seconds
- **And** all session cards are visible in <2 seconds
- **And** images lazy-load as I scroll (not all 25 at once)
- **And** the page is interactive before all images finish loading

### Edge Cases

#### Empty Favorites
- **Given** I have not favorited any sessions (or favorites feature not built)
- **When** I view the schedule
- **Then** no "My Favorites" section appears
- **And** I see all 4 blocks normally

#### Large Screen (>1920px)
- **Given** I am viewing on a large desktop monitor
- **When** the page renders
- **Then** session cards do not stretch excessively
- **And** maximum container width is enforced (e.g., 1400px)
- **And** content remains centered and readable

#### Slow Image Loading
- **Given** some session thumbnails are slow to load
- **When** the page renders
- **Then** I see skeleton loaders or placeholder images
- **And** the page layout does not shift when images load (reserved space)
- **And** other content is still interactive while images load

#### Browser Back Button
- **Given** I am on the schedule page (which is the homepage)
- **When** I click browser back
- **Then** I navigate to my previous site (before arriving at Career Launch)
- **Or** nothing happens if I arrived directly at the URL

### Technical Constraints
- Must work on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Must work on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- Must handle 25 session thumbnails efficiently (lazy loading)
- Must maintain performance on low-end devices (3-year-old smartphones)
- Must support keyboard navigation (Tab through session cards)
- Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

### UX Considerations

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Event branding and dates prominent at top
- Clear block headers (larger font, bold, distinct color)
- Session cards have consistent sizing within blocks
- Thumbnail images high quality but not overwhelming file size

**Layout:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        CAREER LAUNCH WEEK: December 1-5          │
│           25+ Career Sessions Available           │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Similar for Blocks 2, 3, 4]
```

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Hover on session card: Slight elevation and shadow
- Click anywhere on card: Navigate to session detail page
- Star icon (if implemented): Click to favorite (doesn't navigate away)
- Scroll is smooth and natural
- No jarring transitions or animations

**Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>` for structure
- Each block has proper heading hierarchy (`<h2>` for block titles)
- Session cards have descriptive alt text on thumbnails
- Keyboard focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- Screen reader announces "25 career sessions available, organized in 4 blocks"

## 5.2 Feature 2: Session Detail Pages

### User Story
**As an educator**, I want to view detailed information about a session including a trailer video, full description, and presenter bio, so that I can make an informed decision about whether this content is appropriate for my students before committing class time.

### Priority
**P0 - Must Have** (Essential for informed decision-making)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- **Given** I click on a session card from the schedule
- **When** the session detail page loads
- **Then** I see:
  - Session title (large, prominent)
  - Session metadata (duration, grade level, industry, presenter name)
  - Embedded trailer video (1-2 minutes, Vimeo player)
  - Full description (3-4 paragraphs)
  - Learning objectives (bullet list)
  - Presenter bio (2-3 paragraphs)
  - Presenter photo (if available)
  - Prominent "Watch with Your Class" button

#### Trailer Video Behavior
- **Given** I am on a session detail page
- **When** I view the trailer section
- **Then** I see a Vimeo embedded player
- **And** I can click play to watch the 1-2 minute trailer
- **And** the video plays inline (no modal, no navigation away)
- **And** I have access to standard Vimeo controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)
- **And** watching the trailer does NOT trigger the registration form
- **And** trailer views are NOT tracked (preview only)

#### Watch with Your Class Button
- **Given** I have reviewed the session details
- **When** I decide to show this to my class
- **Then** I see a large, prominent "Watch with Your Class" button
- **And** clicking it opens the combined registration form as a modal
- **And** the button is accessible at both top and bottom of page (optional: sticky on mobile)

#### Content Layout
- **Given** I am viewing the session detail page
- **When** I scroll down
- **Then** I see sections in this order:
  1. Hero section: Title, metadata, visual branding
  2. Trailer video (embedded Vimeo player)
  3. Session description (3-4 paragraphs about the session)
  4. Learning objectives (bulleted list: "What you'll learn")
  5. Presenter bio and photo (who is teaching this session)
  6. "Watch with Your Class" button (repeated at bottom)

#### Direct URL Access
- **Given** I have a direct link to a session (e.g., from an email)
- **When** I visit the URL
- **Then** I land directly on the session detail page
- **And** I see all session information immediately (no authentication required)
- **And** I can watch the trailer and read details
- **And** when I click "Watch with Your Class", the combined form appears

### Edge Cases

#### Missing Trailer
- **Given** a session does not have a trailer video
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** the trailer section is hidden
- **And** the description section moves up
- **And** there is no broken video embed or error message

#### Very Long Description
- **Given** a session description is >1000 words
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** the full description is displayed
- **Or** description is truncated with "Read more" expansion link
- **And** page performance is not impacted

#### No Presenter Photo
- **Given** a presenter has no photo available
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** a placeholder avatar or initials circle is shown
- **And** the bio text is still displayed normally

#### Browser Back Button
- **Given** I am on a session detail page
- **When** I click browser back
- **Then** I return to the schedule page
- **And** my scroll position is preserved (I'm at the block I came from)

#### Slow Trailer Video Load
- **Given** the trailer video is slow to buffer
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** I see a loading indicator in the video player area
- **And** the rest of the page content is visible and readable
- **And** I can scroll and read while video loads

### Technical Constraints
- Vimeo embed must work in all major browsers
- Page must render in <1.5 seconds (3G connection)
- URLs must be shareable (e.g., /session/nursing-career-pathways)
- Must work with browser back/forward navigation
- Trailer videos hosted on Vimeo (not self-hosted)
- Must support keyboard navigation (tab through interactive elements)

### UX Considerations

**Hero Section:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [< Back to Schedule]                            │
│                                                  │
│      NURSING CAREER PATHWAYS                     │
│      Healthcare | 35 minutes | Grades 9-12      │
│      Presented by Dr. Sarah Johnson, RN          │
│                                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Content Hierarchy:**

- Optional: "Preview this session" subheading

**Description & Learning Objectives:**
- Clear section headers: "About This Session", "What You'll Learn"
- Short, scannable paragraphs (3-4 sentences each)
- Learning objectives as bulleted list (3-5 items)
- Professional but approachable tone

**Presenter Section:**
- Presenter photo (circular, 150x150px)
- Name and credentials clearly displayed
- Bio in 2-3 short paragraphs
- Optional: Links to presenter's professional profiles

**Call-to-Action:**
- "Watch with Your Class" button large and prominent
- Primary brand color (high contrast)

## 5.3 Feature 3: Combined Registration Form (Profile + Context)

### User Story
**As an educator ready to watch a video**, I want to provide my information and class context in a single, streamlined form, so that I can start watching immediately without multiple steps or unnecessary friction.

### Priority
**P0 - Must Have** (This is the ONLY data collection point in the entire flow)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path: First-Time User
- **Given** I click "Watch with Your Class" for the first time
- **When** the combined form modal appears
- **Then** I see 6 required fields in one form:
  1. Name (text input)
  2. Email (text input)
  3. School (dropdown, pre-populated by board)
  4. Role (radio buttons: Guidance Counsellor / Subject Teacher / Administrator / Other)
  5. Class Size (radio buttons: Less than 25 / 25 to 35 / Large group)
  6. Grade Level (radio buttons: Grade 9-10 / Grade 11-12 / Mixed)
- **And** all fields are empty (no pre-fill)
- **And** "Start Video" button is disabled (grayed out)
- **And** I see friendly copy: "Quick info before we start the video"

#### Happy Path: Returning User (Pre-fill)
- **Given** I have watched a video before (cookie exists)
- **When** I click "Watch with Your Class" on a different session
- **Then** the combined form modal appears with ALL 6 fields pre-filled:
  - Name: "Jane Smith"
  - Email: "jane.smith@torontodsb.ca"
  - School: "Central High School" (selected)
  - Role: "Subject Teacher" (selected)
  - Class Size: "25 to 35" (selected)
  - Grade Level: "Grade 11-12" (selected)
- **And** "Start Video" button is ENABLED immediately
- **And** I can click "Start Video" without changing anything (~1 second)
- **Or** I can change any field before clicking

#### Form Validation: Real-Time
- **Given** I am filling out the form
- **When** I complete each field
- **Then** validation occurs on blur (when I leave the field)
- **And** error messages appear inline if validation fails:
  - Name: "Please enter your full name" (if <2 characters)
  - Email: "Please enter a valid email address" (if invalid format)
  - School: "Please select your school" (if not selected)
  - Role: (radio group, can't be invalid once selected)
  - Class Size: (radio group, can't be invalid once selected)
  - Grade Level: (radio group, can't be invalid once selected)
- **And** error messages disappear as soon as field becomes valid

#### Progressive Disclosure: Large Group
- **Given** I select "Large group" for class size
- **When** the selection changes
- **Then** a number input field appears below the class size options
- **And** the label reads: "How many students? (36-500)"
- **And** the field requires a number ≥36 and ≤500
- **And** the "Start Video" button remains disabled until valid number entered

#### Form Submission
- **Given** I have filled all 6 required fields correctly
- **When** I click "Start Video"
- **Then** the form submits immediately
- **And** I see a brief loading state (<500ms)
- **And** the modal closes
- **And** the video starts playing immediately (no intermediate screens)
- **And** my data is saved to the database (User + ViewingEvent records)
- **And** a cookie is set with my submission data (for pre-fill)

#### Button State Management
- **Given** I am filling out the form
- **When** ANY required field is empty or invalid
- **Then** "Start Video" button is disabled (grayed out, cursor: not-allowed)
- **And** button shows: "Start Video (Fill all fields)"

- **Given** I have filled all 6 required fields correctly
- **When** validation passes
- **Then** "Start Video" button is enabled (primary color, cursor: pointer)
- **And** button shows: "Start Video"

### Edge Cases

#### Modal Close Without Submitting
- **Given** the modal is open
- **When** I click outside the modal OR press Escape key
- **Then** the modal closes
- **And** the video does NOT start playing
- **And** I remain on the session detail page
- **And** I can click "Watch with Your Class" again to retry

#### Incomplete Selection
- **Given** I have filled some fields but not all
- **When** I try to click "Start Video" (button is disabled)
- **Then** button does not respond (no click event)
- **And** I see inline errors on empty/invalid fields

#### Changing Pre-filled Values
- **Given** my previous selection was "25 to 35" and "Grade 11-12"
- **When** the form opens with these pre-filled
- **And** I change class size to "Large group"
- **Then** the number input field appears
- **And** I must enter a valid number (36-500)
- **And** when I submit, cookie updates with new values
- **And** next time, "Large group" + my number will be pre-filled

#### Database Write Failure
- **Given** I submit the form
- **When** the database is temporarily unavailable
- **Then** the system retries up to 3 times
- **And** if all retries fail, the video STILL plays (don't block user)
- **And** the failed submission is queued for later sync
- **And** an error is logged (but NOT shown to user)

#### Cookie Blocked by Browser
- **Given** my browser blocks third-party cookies
- **When** I submit the form
- **Then** form submission succeeds (database writes still work)
- **And** cookie fails to set (pre-fill won't work next time)
- **And** user is NOT notified (graceful degradation)
- **And** next time, form appears empty (user must fill again)

### Technical Constraints
- All 6 fields required (no optional fields in MVP)
- Email format validation: must contain @, must have domain
- Name validation: 2-100 characters, letters/spaces/hyphens/apostrophes only
- School dropdown: Must be dynamically populated based on email domain
- Large group: number must be integer between 36-500
- Form must work on mobile (touch-friendly, keyboard optimized)
- Modal must trap focus (Tab only cycles through modal elements)
- Database writes must complete in <500ms (95th percentile)

### UX Considerations

**Modal Design:**
```

## 5.4 Feature 4: Video Player & Engagement Tracking

### User Story
**As an educator**, I want the video to start playing immediately after submitting my information, with reliable streaming and progress tracking, so that my students can watch the session without technical difficulties or delays.

### Priority
**P0 - Must Have** (This is the core content delivery mechanism)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path: Video Playback
- **Given** I have submitted the combined form successfully
- **When** the form closes
- **Then** the Vimeo player appears on the page
- **And** the video begins playing automatically
- **And** transition from form to video takes <1 second
- **And** I have access to standard Vimeo controls:
  - Play/Pause
  - Volume control
  - Timeline scrubbing
  - Fullscreen mode
  - Quality settings
  - Captions/subtitles (if available)

#### Playback Tracking: Duration
- **Given** the video is playing
- **When** playback progresses
- **Then** the system tracks total watch duration
- **And** updates the ViewingEvent record every 5 seconds
- **And** accurately captures:
  - Current playback position (seconds)
  - Total time spent watching (cumulative seconds)
  - Timestamp of last update

#### Playback Tracking: Completion
- **Given** I am watching a video
- **When** I reach 80% of the video duration
- **Then** the system marks this viewing as "completed"
- **And** sets `completed = true` in ViewingEvent record
- **And** records `completed_at` timestamp
- **And** completion is based on "furthest point reached" not "time spent"

- **Example:** 40-minute video
  - Watching 32+ minutes = completed (80%)
  - Even if I scrub forward and backward, as long as I hit 32-minute mark = completed

#### Playback Tracking: Scrubbing
- **Given** I am watching a video
- **When** I scrub from minute 5 to minute 30
- **Then** the system updates `completion_percentage` to highest point reached
- **And** watch_duration reflects only time actively watching (not skipped time)
- **And** completion is still based on highest point (I'm 75% complete after scrubbing to min 30 of 40-min video)

#### Playback Tracking: Pause & Resume
- **Given** I pause the video at minute 15
- **When** I resume 2 minutes later
- **Then** tracking resumes from minute 15
- **And** the 2-minute pause is NOT counted in watch_duration
- **And** the system continues updating completion_percentage as I watch

### Edge Cases

#### Video Load Failure
- **Given** the Vimeo video fails to load
- **When** the player attempts to initialize
- **Then** I see an error message: "Video temporarily unavailable. Please refresh the page."
- **And** I have option to return to session detail page
- **And** ViewingEvent is still recorded (with 0 duration and 0% completion)
- **And** error is logged to monitoring service

#### Multiple Pauses
- **Given** I pause the video 10 times during playback
- **When** I resume each time
- **Then** the system continues tracking cumulative watch duration
- **And** total duration is sum of all play periods (not pause periods)
- **And** completion_percentage updates correctly

#### Exiting Before Completion
- **Given** I have watched 20 minutes of a 40-minute video (50%)
- **When** I close the browser or navigate away
- **Then** the system saves my progress
- **And** ViewingEvent shows:
  - watch_duration: 1200 seconds (20 minutes)
  - completion_percentage: 50
  - completed: false
- **And** data is preserved (not lost)

#### Refreshing Page During Playback
- **Given** I am watching a video at minute 25
- **When** I refresh the page
- **Then** the video player resets to the beginning
- **And** a NEW ViewingEvent is created (separate from first)
- **And** the previous ViewingEvent is saved as-is (incomplete)
- **Note:** Multiple ViewingEvents for same user/session are acceptable

#### Network Interruption
- **Given** I am watching and my internet disconnects
- **When** the video buffer runs out
- **Then** Vimeo's native error handling displays
- **And** I can retry when connection returns
- **And** tracking resumes when video resumes
- **And** system logs network error

#### Rewatching Same Session
- **Given** I have already watched Session A to completion
- **When** I click "Watch with Your Class" on Session A again
- **Then** the combined form appears again (not bypassed)
- **And** I can provide different class context (e.g., different class period)
- **And** a NEW ViewingEvent is created
- **And** both viewings count toward student reach totals

### Technical Constraints
- Vimeo embed must work in all major browsers
- Must handle various network speeds (Vimeo adaptive bitrate)
- Tracking updates every 5 seconds (balance between accuracy and performance)
- Database updates must not impact playback performance
- Must respect Vimeo rate limits for API calls
- Must work on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

### UX Considerations

**Player Placement Options:**

**Option A: Embedded on Session Detail Page**
```
[User clicks "Start Video"]
↓
[Form closes]
↓
[Page scrolls to video player section]
↓
[Video appears and auto-plays]
```

**Option B: Modal/Overlay**
```
[User clicks "Start Video"]
↓
[Form closes]
↓
[Video opens in fullscreen overlay]
↓
[User can exit overlay to return to session page]
```

**Recommendation for MVP:** Option A (simpler, works on all devices)

**Player Controls:**
- All standard Vimeo controls visible and functional
- Fullscreen button prominent (especially important on mobile)
- Quality selector available (if multiple qualities provided)
- Captions/subtitles button visible (if available)
- Timeline is scrubbable (user can jump to any point)

**Loading States:**
- Spinner or skeleton loader while video buffers
- Smooth transition from form close to video start
- No jarring UI shifts or blank screens
- Progress indicator if buffering takes >2 seconds

**Post-Playback:**
- When video ends, show "Session Complete! 🎉" message
- Provide clear CTA: "Back to Schedule" button
- Optional: "Watch Another Session" button
- DO NOT auto-play next video (educator should control)

**Error States:**
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Option to retry or report issue
- Contact information for technical support
- Fallback: Return to session detail page

**Accessibility:**
- Video player has keyboard controls (Space = play/pause, arrows = scrub)
- Captions/subtitles available (if provided by Vimeo)
- Screen reader announces video status ("Playing", "Paused", "Complete")
- Focus management (focus returns to appropriate element after playback)

## 5.5 Feature 5: Session Favorites (P1 - Optional)

### User Story
**As an educator**, I want to bookmark sessions I'm interested in showing, so that I can easily find them later when planning my week.

### Priority
**P1 - Important but Not Blocking** (Nice-to-have that enhances UX)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path: Adding Favorite
- **Given** I am viewing the schedule page
- **When** I click the star icon on a session card
- **Then** the session is added to my favorites
- **And** the star icon fills in (visual feedback: outline → filled)
- **And** a "My Favorites" section appears at the top of the schedule (if it wasn't already visible)
- **And** favorites are stored in browser localStorage

#### Happy Path: Removing Favorite
- **Given** I have favorited a session
- **When** I click the filled star icon
- **Then** the session is removed from favorites
- **And** the star icon becomes outlined (filled → outline)
- **And** if no favorites remain, the "My Favorites" section disappears

#### My Favorites Section
- **Given** I have 3 favorited sessions
- **When** I view the schedule
- **Then** I see "My Favorites (3)" at the top of the page
- **And** clicking/tapping expands to show my favorited session cards
- **And** these cards link directly to session detail pages
- **And** cards show same info as schedule: thumbnail, title, duration, grade level

### Edge Cases

#### Favorites Across Devices
- **Given** I favorite sessions on my laptop
- **When** I visit the site on my phone
- **Then** favorites do NOT sync (localStorage is device-specific)
- **And** I must re-favorite on the new device
- **Note:** Phase 2 could sync via database if needed

#### Browser Clear/Incognito Mode
- **Given** I am using incognito mode
- **When** I favorite sessions
- **Then** favorites persist during my session
- **And** favorites are lost when I close the browser
- **And** I see a subtle note: "Favorites are saved to this device only"

#### Maximum Favorites
- **Given** there is no technical limit on favorites
- **When** I favorite all 25 sessions
- **Then** all 25 appear in "My Favorites" section
- **And** the section may become scrollable or paginated
- **And** performance remains acceptable

#### localStorage Unavailable
- **Given** my browser has localStorage disabled or blocked
- **When** I try to favorite a session
- **Then** star icon still toggles (visual feedback)
- **But** favorite is NOT persisted (lost on page refresh)
- **And** user is NOT notified (graceful degradation)

### Technical Constraints
- localStorage has ~5-10MB limit (plenty for storing session IDs)
- Must handle localStorage being unavailable (private browsing, disabled)
- Must not break if localStorage is cleared mid-session
- Star icon click should NOT trigger navigation to session detail
- Favorites should load quickly (no performance impact)

### UX Considerations

**Visual Design:**
- Star icon: Gold/yellow when filled, gray outline when empty
- Hover state: Tooltip appears ("Add to favorites" or "Remove from favorites")
- Click animation: Subtle scale up/down or color transition
- Icon size: 24x24px (large enough for touch, small enough to not dominate)

**Star Icon Placement:**
- Top-right corner of each session card
- Positioned absolutely so it doesn't affect card layout
- Click area extends beyond icon for easier targeting
- Clear visual separation from card click area

**My Favorites Section:**
- Appears above Block 1 when favorites exist
- Collapsible on mobile (collapsed by default, expand on tap)
- Shows count badge: "My Favorites (5)"
- Same session card design as schedule blocks
- Clear visual distinction (different background color or border)

**Interaction Timing:**
- Instant visual feedback on star click (<100ms)
- localStorage write happens asynchronously (doesn't block UI)
- Smooth animation when adding/removing from favorites
- No page reload or navigation on favorite toggle

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Larger touch target for star icon (48x48px touch area)
- "My Favorites" section collapses to save screen space
- Tap to expand, shows count badge
- Swipe to dismiss (optional enhancement)

**Accessibility:**
- Star icon has aria-label: "Add to favorites" or "Remove from favorites"
- Screen reader announces action: "Added [Session Title] to favorites"
- Keyboard accessible (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to toggle)
- Focus indicator visible on star icon
- "My Favorites" section has proper heading (h2)

**Time to Build:** ~2-4 hours  
**Risk:** Minimal (pure localStorage, no backend complexity)  
**User Value:** Medium-High (helps with planning, increases engagement)

**Recommendation:** Include in MVP if time permits (it's cheap and polishes the experience)

# 6. SUCCESS METRICS & KPIs

## 6.1 North Star Metric

**Total Student Reach** = Sum of all class sizes across all viewing sessions

This is our primary measure of impact because it represents the actual number of students exposed to career education content—which is what school boards pay for and what sponsors care about.

**Calculation Example:**
- Educator A watches Session 1 with 30 students (Grade 11-12)
- Educator A watches Session 2 with 28 students (Grade 9-10, different class)
- Educator B watches Session 1 with 25 students (Grade 11-12)
- Educator C watches Session 3 with 22 students (Mixed)

**Total Student Reach = 30 + 28 + 25 + 22 = 105 students**

**Why this metric matters:**
- Directly ties to event value proposition (student exposure to careers)
- Justifies school board investment ("We reached X students")
- Proves sponsor impact ("Your session reached Y students")
- More meaningful than "views" or "registered users"

## 6.7 Validation Questions We'll Answer

### Did browse-first registration work?
**Metrics to check:**
- Homepage bounce rate (<20% = success)
- Browse-to-watch conversion (>60% = success)
- Time-to-first-video (<30 seconds = success)
- Form completion rate (>95% = success)

**Conclusion:** If these metrics hit targets, browse-first approach is validated

### Was the 4-block structure effective?
**Metrics to check:**
- Block-level view distribution (roughly equal = success)
- Educator feedback about content variety
- Evidence of students seeing multiple different sessions

**Conclusion:** If no one block dominates and educators report good variety, structure works

### Was the class context form a barrier or did educators comply willingly?
**Metrics to check:**
- Form completion rate (>95% = not a barrier)
- Time spent on form (avg <30 seconds = low friction)
- Form abandonment rate (<5% = willing compliance)

**Conclusion:** If >95% complete form quickly, it's not a barrier

### Which sessions had highest completion rates?
**Analysis:**
- Rank all 25 sessions by completion rate
- Identify patterns (industry, duration, presenter style)
- Use for future content curation

**Action Items:**
- Renew high-performing presenters
- Analyze low-completion sessions for lessons learned
- Adjust session length recommendations for next year

### Did email-only entry reduce friction vs traditional login?
**Comparison:**
- Time-to-first-video: <30 sec (vs 90+ with traditional registration)
- Registration completion rate: N/A (no upfront registration)
- First-video-watch rate: 50% (vs ~30-40% with forced registration)

**Conclusion:** If time metrics are faster and watch rates are higher, approach is validated

---

# 8. RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

## 8.1 Technical Risks

### Risk: Database Performance Under Load
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** High (platform unusable if database fails)

**Indicators:**
- Slow query response times (>1 second)
- Connection pool exhausted
- Timeouts on form submission or tracking updates

**Mitigation:**
- Use Supabase's connection pooling (handles up to 500 concurrent connections)
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields (email, sessionId, startedAt)
- Implement retry logic for failed database writes (up to 3 retries)
- Cache session data (changes infrequently, can be cached for 1 hour)
- Load test with 1000 concurrent users before launch

**Fallback Plan:**
- If database becomes unavailable, video playback continues (don't block users)
- Queue failed tracking events in browser localStorage for later sync
- Upgrade Supabase plan if free tier limits are hit (unlikely but possible)

### Risk: Vimeo Video Playback Issues
**Likelihood:** Low (Vimeo is reliable)  
**Impact:** High (core content delivery fails)

**Indicators:**
- Videos fail to load or buffer excessively
- Playback errors in browser console
- User reports of "video unavailable"

**Mitigation:**
- Test all 25 videos thoroughly before launch
- Use Vimeo Pro account (higher reliability than free tier)
- Ensure videos are set to correct privacy settings (embed-only, no password)
- Have backup embed codes ready
- Vimeo provides adaptive bitrate streaming (handles various network speeds)

**Fallback Plan:**
- If specific video fails, display error message with support contact
- If Vimeo has widespread outage, postpone event day (communicate to boards)
- Have video files backed up locally (can re-upload to Vimeo if needed)

### Risk: Cookie Blocking Breaks Pre-fill
**Likelihood:** Medium (some users have strict privacy settings)  
**Impact:** Low (graceful degradation)

**Indicators:**
- High percentage of returning users reporting "form not pre-filled"
- Cookie writes failing in browser console
- Users in incognito mode

**Mitigation:**
- Use first-party cookies (not third-party) - less likely to be blocked
- Set SameSite=Lax (balance between security and functionality)
- Test cookie behavior in various privacy modes
- Provide clear messaging: "Cookies help us remember your info"

**Fallback Plan:**
- If cookies fail, users simply fill form each time (still acceptable)
- Form is only 6 fields, takes ~20 seconds even without pre-fill
- Consider server-side session storage in Phase 2 (not needed for MVP)

---

## 8.2 User Experience Risks

### Risk: Users Abandon 6-Field Form
**Likelihood:** Low (form appears at high commitment point)  
**Impact:** Medium (lose some potential watchers)

**Indicators:**
- Form abandonment rate >10%
- Users click "Watch with Your Class" but don't complete form
- Time-on-form is very long (>60 seconds)

**Mitigation:**
- Clear, friendly copy: "Quick info before we start the video"
- Large, touch-friendly inputs (especially on mobile)
- Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- Progressive disclosure (number input only appears if needed)
- Pre-fill for returning users (1-second subsequent watches)

**Fallback Plan:**
- If abandonment is high (>15%), consider optional "Skip for now" with anonymous viewing
- Simplify form to 4 fields (remove role and custom school input)
- Add incentive messaging: "This helps presenters see their impact!"

### Risk: Educators Can't Find Relevant Sessions
**Likelihood:** Low (good filtering by block structure)  
**Impact:** Medium (lower engagement)

**Indicators:**
- Low click-through rate from schedule to detail pages (<50%)
- Short time-on-site (<2 minutes)
- User feedback about "too hard to find what I need"

**Mitigation:**
- Clear block headers explaining the structure
- Industry tags visible on each session card
- Grade level tags visible on each session card
- Session descriptions are concise and scannable
- Optional: Add search/filter by industry, grade level (if time permits)

**Fallback Plan:**
- Post-event, add search and filter functionality for next year
- Create curated "recommended for you" based on role (Phase 2)
- Provide printable PDF schedule educators can review offline

### Risk: Low First-Video-Watch Rate (<30%)
**Likelihood:** Low (browse-first should increase conversion)  
**Impact:** High (event fails if no one watches)

**Indicators:**
- Week 1 pre-event traffic is low
- High bounce rate on schedule page (>40%)
- Low click-through to session detail pages

**Mitigation:**
- Clear pre-event communication from school boards
- Provide ready-to-send email templates for boards
- Create quick "how-to" video for educators (30 seconds)
- Emphasize "no registration required" in all messaging
- Show sample session in promotional materials

**Fallback Plan:**
- If participation is low by Day 2, open access directly to students
- Promote video clips/highlights on social media for broader reach
- Extend event by 1-2 days to capture more participation
- Create supplemental educator guides to drive post-event adoption

---

## 8.3 Data & Reporting Risks

### Risk: Low Class Context Compliance (<70%)
**Likelihood:** Low (form is blocking, required for video)  
**Impact:** Medium (can't measure student reach accurately)

**Indicators:**
- High video playback without form submission (shouldn't happen - form is blocking)
- Educators finding workarounds to skip form (e.g., directly accessing video URL)
- Many "unknown" or "0 students" entries in database

**Mitigation:**
- Form blocks video playback (no workaround in UI)
- Positive framing: "Help presenters understand their impact"
- Pre-fill reduces burden for repeat users
- Form is simple and quick (6 fields, ~20 seconds)

**Fallback Plan:**
- Can still report "views" and "participating educators"
- Use completion rates as engagement proxy
- Acknowledge limitation in sponsor reports: "Minimum of X students reached"
- Phase 2: Explore different incentive structures or gamification

### Risk: Inaccurate Student Reach Estimates
**Likelihood:** Medium (estimates based on ranges, not exact counts)  
**Impact:** Low (acceptable margin of error)

**Indicators:**
- Wide variance in class size selections
- Many "Large group" selections with unclear numbers
- Feedback that estimates don't match reality

**Mitigation:**
- Use conservative estimates (Less than 25 → 20 students)
- Encourage exact numbers for "Large group" option
- Validate that estimates are reasonable (20-35 is typical class size)
- Accept margin of error as inherent to estimation

**Fallback Plan:**
- Report as "estimated student reach" with disclaimer
- Focus on trends rather than precise numbers
- Phase 2: Add optional "exact count" field for all selections

---

## 8.4 Business & Stakeholder Risks

### Risk: School Board Dissatisfaction
**Likelihood:** Low (platform provides clear value)  
**Impact:** High (renewals depend on satisfaction)

**Indicators:**
- Post-event survey scores <3.5/5.0
- Negative feedback about data quality
- Boards say reporting was insufficient

**Mitigation:**
- Proactive communication throughout event week
- Provide clear, actionable reports within 1 week post-event
- Include specific metrics boards care about (student reach, school participation)
- Offer to do 15-minute debrief calls with each board

**Fallback Plan:**
- If data is insufficient, supplement with qualitative feedback from educators
- Create case studies highlighting success stories
- Offer discounted renewal for boards willing to try again

### Risk: Sponsor/Presenter Dissatisfaction
**Likelihood:** Low (engagement data is valuable)  
**Impact:** Medium (future content pipeline)

**Indicators:**
- Sponsors say impact data isn't useful for their needs
- Low interest in participating in future events
- Requests for different metrics we can't provide

**Mitigation:**
- Proactive communication about what data will be provided
- Share sample reports before event (set expectations)
- Highlight specific metrics that matter: student reach, completion rate, geographic distribution
- Follow up personally with each sponsor post-event

**Fallback Plan:**
- Supplement quantitative data with qualitative testimonials
- Gather educator feedback about specific sessions
- Phase 2: Add more granular analytics (time-of-day patterns, device types, etc.)

---

## 8.5 Launch Day Risks

### Risk: Server/Hosting Outage
**Likelihood:** Very Low (Vercel/Netlify are reliable)  
**Impact:** Critical (platform completely unavailable)

**Indicators:**
- Site returns 502/503 errors
- Homepage won't load
- Database connection fails

**Mitigation:**
- Use enterprise-grade hosting (Vercel or Netlify with paid plan)
- Monitor uptime with status page (e.g., UptimeRobot)
- Have backup hosting ready (can redeploy to different provider in ~1 hour)
- Static site generation = minimal server-side dependencies

**Fallback Plan:**
- If hosting goes down, communicate immediately to boards
- Activate backup hosting (deploy to Netlify if Vercel fails, or vice versa)
- Update DNS if needed (propagation takes 1-24 hours)
- Extend event by 1 day to compensate for downtime

### Risk: Overwhelming Traffic (1000+ Concurrent Users)
**Likelihood:** Low (20 boards, ~1000 educators total)  
**Impact:** Medium (slow performance, not complete failure)

**Indicators:**
- Page load times spike to >5 seconds
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Vimeo player buffers excessively

**Mitigation:**
- Static site = infinitely scalable frontend (CDN)
- Database = Supabase handles 500 connections (should be sufficient)
- Videos = Vimeo handles unlimited concurrent streams
- Load test before launch (simulate 1000 users)

**Fallback Plan:**
- If database struggles, cache more aggressively (trade freshness for performance)
- If video buffering is an issue, it's a Vimeo problem (not ours) - communicate to users
- Upgrade Supabase plan if connection limit is hit (takes ~5 minutes)

### Risk: Critical Bug Discovered on Launch Day
**Likelihood:** Medium (bugs happen)  
**Impact:** High (depends on bug severity)

**Indicators:**
- Form submission fails
- Video player doesn't initialize
- Tracking isn't saving to database

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive testing in Week 4 (reduce likelihood)
- Have developers on-call during launch day
- Quick-fix deployment pipeline ready (Vercel = instant deploys)
- Error monitoring (Sentry) alerts team immediately

**Fallback Plan:**
- Triage: Critical (blocks watching) vs Non-critical (tracking fails)
- If critical: Fix and deploy immediately (within 1-2 hours)
- If non-critical: Fix by end of day, communicate to affected users
- Have fallback contact method (email, phone) for urgent issues
